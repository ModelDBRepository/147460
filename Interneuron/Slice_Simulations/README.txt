Instructions to generate threshold maps and cortical slice simulations

Open and run INPlotSimpleComplete.m

This calls several functions:
	- importfile.m - imports data files generated by NEURON
	- getImgData.m - plots stimulation threshold maps
	- INPlotLines.m - generates line drawings of cell models
	- INcalcprobs3D.m - generates cortical slab and recruitment estimates for a single cell type
		- plotcellsliceactivation.m - generates videos of cell recruitment and separation histograms
	- INnumsdepth.m - generates combined recruitment estimates for all cell types
